    <string name="desc_bulldog">The Bulldog, also known as the English Bulldog or British Bulldog,
        is a medium-sized dog breed. It is a muscular, hefty dog with a wrinkled face and a
        distinctive pushed-in nose. The Kennel Club (UK), the American Kennel Club (US), and the
        United Kennel Club (US) oversee breeding records. Bulldogs are popular pets; they were the
        fifth most popular purebreed in the US in 2017 according to the American Kennel Club.\n
        Bulldogs have a longstanding association with British culture, as the BBC wrote: \"to
        many the Bulldog is a national icon, symbolising pluck and determination.\" During World
        War II, Bulldogs were often likened to Prime Minister Winston Churchill and his defiance
        of Nazi Germany. Dedicated Bulldog fanciers formed the Bulldog Club (England) in 1878, and
        the Bulldog Club of America in 1890.</string>
